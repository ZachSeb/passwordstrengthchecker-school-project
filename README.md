# Overview
hi, this project is a school project I made for my 7th grade science class. 
it's pretty badly written and the first website I've ever uploaded to the internet.
i utilized Mellt's password strength detector (http://mel.lt) to detect a password's strength

all passwords are 100% secure and not recorded at all
